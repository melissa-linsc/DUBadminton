        <h3>Preseason</h3>
            <p>During the summer, there is the chance to apply to join us for our preseason before the start of the year. 
                It is a fun two weeks filled with training sessions, fitness and lots of socials! Applications are announced
            on our socials so be sure to check them out!</p> 
        <h3>Trials</h3>
            <p>We host trial sessions at the beginning of Michaelmas term. Trials are held at Maiden Castle, where captains will select 
                the squad! There is a small fee of £4 to trial to cover costs and you will need your own racquet! 
            If you can't make the trial, we host a retrial for those that missed the first one! </p>
            <p>If you are looking to apply throughout the year, all you need to do is contact us and we can arrange to see you play!</p>
        <h3>Development Squad</h3>
            <p>For casual play, sign up for our development squad. There are weekly training sessions on Sundays 11-1pm for 
                our development squad, available to all abilities. Sessions are led by our development squad coordinator as well
                as other DUBADC members, consisting of coaching and games! It is a pay-per-session of £3 or an annual subscription
            of £40 for the year and your own racquet is required. </p>
